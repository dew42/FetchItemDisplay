Please press the button on the MainActivity to fetch and display the list.

On the next screen, press the floating action button to toggle on and off the filtering of null or blank names. The instructions for filtering the blank or null names was a little unclear. I was not sure if you wanted them to be filtered before displaying or if you wanted the user to have the ability to filter or not. I chose to give the user the filter ability.
